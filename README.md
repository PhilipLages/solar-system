# Project Solar System

For this project at [Trybe](https://www.betrybe.com/), I developed my first page using [React js](https://reactjs.org/), that renders the planets of the solar system, and charts containing information about space missions performed over the years.
## Lessons Learned

I have developed skills such as using React, writing code in JSX, creating and importing components for rendering on the screen, and using props and propTypes to validate the application of these props in their components.
## Tech Stack

**Client:** React, Html, CSS and JavaScript.
